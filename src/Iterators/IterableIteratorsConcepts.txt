In Java an iterator is an object that allows a programmer to traverse all the elements of a collection.

1. Most importanthe point of using an iterator is to allow the the client to iterate over the collection of objects, without exposing implementation details. 
This gives you the benefit to change what collection the Iterator iterates over and how each element is served, without making any change the client's code.

For e.g we could have a BookCollection implemented using an ARrayList or HashSet or whatever, We don't want client to have this knowledge.
